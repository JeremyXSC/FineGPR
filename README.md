# Less is More: Learning from Synthetic Data with Fine-grained Attributes for Person Re-Identification
### [Suncheng Xiang](https://JeremyXSC.github.io/)
### [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)

## Overview
In this paper, we construct and label a large-scale synthetic person dataset named FineGPR with fine-grained attribute distribution. Moreover, aiming to
fully exploit the potential of FineGPR and promote the efficient training from millions of synthetic data, we propose an attribute analysis pipeline AOST to learn attribute distribution in target domain, then apply style transfer network to eliminate the gap between synthetic and real-world data and thus is freely deployed to new scenarios. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate that FineGPR with AOST outperforms (or is on par with) existing real and synthetic datasets, which suggests its feasibility for re-ID and proves the proverbial less-is-more principle. We hope this fine-grained dataset could advance research towards re-ID in real scenarios.

## FineGPR Introduction
The FineGPR dataset is generated by a popular GTA5 game engine that can synthesise images under controllable viewpoints, weathers,illuminations and backgrounds, as well as 13 fine-grained attributes at the identity level :+1:. <br>

Our FineGPR dataset provides fine-grained and accurately configurable annotations, including 36 different viewpoints,
7 different kinds of weathers, 7 different kinds of illuminations, and 9 different kinds of backgrounds.

### Viewpoint📷
Definition of different viewpoints. Viewpoints of one identity are sampled at an interval of 10°, e.g. 0°-80° denotes that a person has 9 different angles in total.

### Weather🌨 and Illumination🌟
The exemplars of different weather distribution (left) and illumination distribution (right) from the proposed FineGPR dataset.

### Attributes at the Identity Level⛹️‍♀️
The distributions of attributes at the identity level on FineGPR. The left figure shows the numbers of IDs for each attribute. The middle and right pies illustrate the distribution of the colors of upper-body and low-body clothes respectively.

## Method
💡The two-stage pipeline AOST to learn attribute distribution of target domain. Firstly, we learn attribute distribution of real domain on the basis of XGBoost & PSO learning system. Secondly, we perform style transfer to enhance the reality of optimal dataset. Finally, the transferred data are adopted for downstream re-ID task.

## Results
Performance comparison with existing Real and Synthetic datasets on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03, respectively. Our re-ID baseline system is built only with commonly used softmax cross-entropy loss on vanilla ResNet-50 with no bells and whistles.

## Extendibility
Accompanied with our FineGPR, we also provide some human body masks (Middle) and keypoint locations (Bottom) of all characters during the annotation. We hope that our synthetic dataset FineGPR can not only contribute a lot to the development of generalizable person re-ID, but also advance the research of other computer vision tasks, such as human part segmentation and pose estimation.

## FineGPR-Caption dataset
On the basis of FineGPR, we introduce a dynamic strategy to generate high-quality captions with fine-grained attribute annotations for semantic-based
pretraining. To be more specific, we rearrange the different attributes as word embeddings into caption formula in the different position, and then generate semantically dense caption with high-quality description, which gives rise to our newlyconstructed FineGPR-Caption dataset.

## Ethical Considerations
Our task and dataset were created with careful attention to ethical questions, which we encountered throughout our work. Access to our dataset will be provided for research purposes only and with restrictions on redistribution. Additionally, as we filtered out the sensitive attribute name in our fine-grained attribute annotation, our dataset cannot be easily repurposed for unintended tasks. Importantly, we are very cautious of human-annotation procedure of large scale datasets towards the social and ethical implications. Furthermore, we do not consider the datasets for developing non-research systems without further processing or augmentation. We hope this fine-grained dataset will shed light into potential tasks for the research community to move forward.
